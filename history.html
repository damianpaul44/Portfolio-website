    FIRST DIVISION
    
    Manchester United triumphed in seven First Division Championships before the league was restructured in 1992.
    
    The club's first League Championship was secured in 1908, six years after the name of Newton Heath - league entrants in 1892 - was changed to Manchester United. A second title followed in 1911 but it wasnâ€™t until after the Second World War when United really became a force in English football, under the leadership of Sir Matt Busby.
    
    The Reds finished league runners-up in 1947, 1948, 1949 and 1951 before winning a third League Championship in 1952. The next few years were to see the birth of the famed Busby Babes. More Championships followed in 1956 and 1957 before the tragic events of the Munich air crash, which claimed the lives of 23 people, including eight United players. Busby rebuilt his team successfully in the 1960s, winning the title again in 1965 and 1967.

<p class="talk">After Chelsea won the Double under Carlo Ancelotti in 2009/10, the Reds wrestled the title back to Old Trafford with a success based on the foundation of an incredible home record. After the West Londoners were beaten in front of a jubilant home crowd in a virtual title decider in May 2011, a point at Blackburn sealed the 12th league success of Sir Alex's remarkable reign with Wayne Rooney's penalty ensuring United could not be caught at the top.

  That title set a new record for the English top flight of 19 in total, but United were made to wait for the 20th after missing out in the 2011/12 season by the most agonising of margins - local rivals Manchester City snatched the prize in the dying seconds of their final league game.</p>

<p class="talk">Manchester United are currently the second most successful team in FA Cup history, behind only Arsenal.

  The Red Devils have won the tournament on 12 occasions, leaving them two behind Arsenal. Their first FA Cup win came in 1909 by beating Bristol City 1-0, though the second triumph didn't arrive until 1948.
  
  The most recent victory came back in 2016 under the guidance of Louis van Gaal. The Dutch coach left his role soon after, but goals from Juan Mata and Jesse Lingard late in the day saw Man Utd claim a 2-1 win over Crystal Palace</p>
