      As a driven and passionate individual, I've had the privilege of navigating a journey that has shaped me into a skilled physicist and web developer. My educational background includes:
      <br>

 <br> - Emotan Primary School, where I obtained my First School Leaving Certificate
 <br> - Western Boys High School
 <br> - Gaius Obaseki, where I attained my O-level result
  <br> - Ambrose Alli University, where I earned my Bachelor's degree in Physics
. <br>
      <br>

At Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, i embarked on the pursuit of a Bachelor’s degree in Physics. The university years were far from smooth. Strikes interrupted academic progress, and financial struggles tested my resilience. But i was steadfast, determined to make the most of every opportunity.
<br>
<br>
In my third year, amidst the chaos of academia, i discovered a passion for technology. It was no simple feat balancing web development with my academic responsibilities. Yet, during my second semester,my Industrial Training (I.T.) period, i truly began to shine. i secured a placement at the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA), where my dedication and exceptional work ethic stood out. my seriousness earned me the role of Head of I.T. for that year,a position that brought its own office and invaluable exposure to professional tools and responsibilities.
<br>
<br>
   As the final year approached, the challenges intensified, but i braved through, keeping my eyes on the prize. After graduation, i decided to focus on web development wholeheartedly. i enrolled in a five-month training program at Complete Computer Institute, where i honed my skills and gained deeper expertise.my hard work culminated in a standout project presentation, earning recognition as the best in the program. 

   <br><br>
   I use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to produce responsive websites and web apps that provide users the best and most appropriate experience suited to their device and browser.
   <br>

    I write standards based code that is semantic, accessible, search-engine friendly, easy to maintain, cross browser compatible, and performant.

Building a future-proof and easy-to-maintain website is achieved by breaking down a web page into its smallest pieces, often called components, and building them in a way that exists outside the context of the design they first appear in. <br><br>This allows for components that can be re-used in other areas of a website as it grows and makes the intention easier for other developers to understand and test. Wherever possible, I find it valuable to create a style guide (using Storybook for example) that acts as a document for a reusable and maintainable code base. All involved in a project can rely on a style guide to understand a project’s language and produce a more consistent user experience. Re-usable components make for a website that can quickly grow as does your business.
<br> <br>
   
Throughout my journey, I've learned the importance of resilience, adaptability, and dedication. I'm excited to leverage my skills and experience to make a meaningful impact in the world of physics and web development."
